In the following project (as part of advanced programming course), i created a system of pokemon battles.     
The system contains a Pokedex which includes all the Pokemons that are currently in the system, followed by basic data about them
such as type, weight, height and strenght. Also, by choosing 2 of the available Pokemons, you can have a battle between them.    
Hope you will enjoy!

The modules I used -     
Pokemon - it contains implementation of all the functions required for Pokemon and their types.   
LinkedList - which contains the implementation of all the functions required for the generic linked list and the generic elements it accepts into it.    
MaxHeap - which contains the implementations of all the functions required for a generic heap and the generic elements it accepts into it.    
BattleByCategory - in which the implementations of all the functions required for the battle phase are found.   
Defs.h - contains the enums defined in the work (bool, status) and additional definitions given in the work file.    
MainSecond.c â€“ contains the step of reading from the file, and then implementing the menu according to CASES.     
 In addition, the MAIN handles calls to functions that deals with memory releases and performs an orderly exit from the program if necessary.
